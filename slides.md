### 3 key factors for evaluating information
1. Relevance
2. Purpose

#### Scope and depth
* Does the source cover a wide scope of material with limited depth?
* Does the source cover a narrow scope of material with significant depth?

#### Rhetoric
* Does the source aim to persuade?
* Does the source aim to inform?

#### Audience
* Was the source created for a general audience? (Popular literature)
* Was the source created for specialists? (Scholarly literature)


### Validity

#### Authority
* Is the author/creator an authority on the topic?
